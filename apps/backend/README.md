# Backend API

This is the backend folder of the project built with **Node.js**. The server handles API requests, processes data, and interacts with the database. The application follows best practices in terms of code structure and RESTful API design.

## Features

- **Node.js** with **Express.js** for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB** for database storage (using **Mongoose** as an ODM).
- **JWT Authentication** for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Environment variables** for configuration management.
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture for better project organization.
- **Error Handling** with custom middleware.
- **Request validation** using `Joi` or `express-validator`.
- **CORS** support for cross-origin requests.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **MongoDB** (for local development or provide a MongoDB connection string)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `backend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo/backend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the `backend` folder and add the necessary environment variables:

   ```bash
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

### Running the server

1. Start the server in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. The server will run on `http://localhost:5000/` (or the port defined in `.env`).

### API Endpoints

The following are the main API routes available in this backend:

- **Authentication**:  
  - `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user.
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - Log in a user.
- **User**:  
  - `GET /api/users/:id` - Fetch a user by ID.
  - `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user information.
  - `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete a user account.
- **Other API routes** can be documented here...
